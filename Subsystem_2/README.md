README for the Subsystem_2
=======

Scripts
-------
* latin_hyper_cube.m - used for sampling
* area_script.m - used to check the Rsq normalised model for area
* mass_script.m - used to check the Rsq normalised model and real model for mass
* static_stress_script.m - used to find and check the Rsq normalised model for static stress
* drop_stress_script.m - used to find and check the Rsq normalised model for drop stress

* std_constraints.m - normalising constraints
* optimise.m - optimises using gradient (with iteration graph) and non-gradient based methods, and outputs results

Execution time
-------
The execution time is approximately 2 seconds

Dependencies
-------
Used in MATLAB R2016b  
Deep Learning Toolbox to use the 'mapstd' function
