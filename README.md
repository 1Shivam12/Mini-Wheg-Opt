DE4 Opti Coursework 2018/19: Code Submission
============
This repository is a simple example/shell of how we expect the source code for
your coursework to be submitted. 

Ensure that your code can be executed to reproduce the numerical (where
deterministic, otherwise explained) and graphical results provided in your
reports at the system and subsystem levels. Please use the following directory
structure:  

Directory Structure
-----------
1. System level optimisation
2. Subsystem_1
3. Subsystem_2

The first folder should contain all necessary code and files to reproduce the
results presented for the system level optimisation. 

The Subsystem folders should contain all necessary code and files such that the
results for the stand-alone subsystem optimisations that you have worked on
individually can be reproduced. This is important, as it is weighted 

Executing the Code
----------
Create a README for each of the directories containing the following
information: 

1. List any software/library prerequisites/dependencies needed to run the code
2. Specify the main script 
3. Provide an indication of the typical performance (e.g. execution time
