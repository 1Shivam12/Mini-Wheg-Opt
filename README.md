DE4 Opti Coursework 2018/19: Code Submission
============
This repository is a simple example/shell of how we expect the source code for
your coursework to be submitted. 

Ensure that your code can be executed to reproduce the numerical (where
deterministic, otherwise explained) and graphical results provided in your
reports at the system and subsystem levels. Please use the following directory
structure:  

Directory Structure
-----------
1. System
2. Subsystem_1
3. Subsystem_2

The System directory should contain all necessary code and files to reproduce
the results presented for the system level optimisation. 

The Subsystem_x folders should contain all necessary code and files such that
the results for the stand-alone subsystem optimisations that you have worked on
individually can be reproduced. 

**NOTE:** The Subsystem_x directories are significantly more important than 
System on an individual basis. Students take sole responsibility for ensuring
that the quality and accuracy of their Subsystem directories.

Executing the Code
----------
Create a README for each of the directories containing the following
information: 

1. List any software/library prerequisites/dependencies needed to run the code
2. Specify the main script 
3. Provide an indication of the typical performance (e.g. execution time, with
indication of processor and operating system)

Open Source versus Private 
----------
You have an opportunity to create a web page in support of your project.  Follow
the instructions to add a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com). 

This has the added advantage of allowing you to showcase your work to the world
and complement your digital portfolios. You may use this opportunity to include
any high quality images or simulations that might not be suitable for inclusion
in your reports.  

If you choose to do this, we also recommend that you upload a copy of your final
report.  

If you would prefer your project to be private, please create private GitHub
repository and provide access to [David](<mailto:david.boyle@imperial.ac.uk>)
and [Nan](<mailto:n.li09@imperial.ac.uk>).

In the case of a private repository, you may still include additional material
in support of your project.
